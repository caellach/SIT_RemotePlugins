## Warning

Scary message:

You should understand the capability of this mod and trust the server owner before using it. This will download and place arbitrary code into your EFT BepInEx plugins directory from the server you connect to; that code will then be run from the game client. Except for file consistency between client and server, there are no checks on the mods that are added. This is a great tool for convenience but it has possible risk.

I am not liable for anything done using this mod. Use at your own risk.
